This was born out of a recent habit I developed of using VSCode as my terminal because I liked having the file navigator and text view handy. But the limitation is that it doesn't move with you. Also, it's not [Mac-assed](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/20/mac-assed-mac-apps).

Specifically, this is a proof of concept using [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm) for the bulk of the hard part.
